#Titanic Survival Prediction
This project predicts the survival of Titanic passengers using machine learning. It provides a web-based interface for users to upload a CSV file of passenger data and view predictions and analysis results.
#Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project is built to analyze passenger data and predict survival outcomes based on historical Titanic data. By leveraging machine learning, the project considers several passenger features to make predictions, including:
Passenger Class (Pclass): Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).
Age: The age of the passenger.
Gender (Sex): Male or Female.
Number of Siblings/Spouses aboard (SibSp): Family members traveling together.
Number of Parents/Children aboard (Parch): Family connections onboard.
Ticket Fare (Fare): The amount paid for the ticket.
The project uses Python with Flask for the backend, making it user-friendly and accessible via a web interface.
Features

#Key Features:
Interactive Web Interface:
Users can upload a CSV file with passenger data.
The results, including survival analysis, are displayed dynamically.
Dynamic Analysis:
The system calculates survival statistics such as:
Total passengers.
Number of survivors and non-survivors.
Predictions are based on an existing machine learning model.
Extendable:
Additional features such as visualizations and real-time predictions can be integrated.
The modular design allows for easy upgrades.

#Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Framework: Flask (for web application)
Libraries:
Pandas (data manipulation)
Scikit-learn (machine learning)
Jupyter Notebook(model training and testing)

#How to Use the Application
Upload a Dataset:
On the landing page, upload a CSV file containing passenger data.
The file should follow the structure of the Titanic dataset, including fields like Pclass, Sex, Age, etc.
View Results:
After uploading, the application will process the file and display:
Total number of passengers.
Number of survivors.
Number of non-survivors.
Upload Another File:
Use the "Upload Another File" link to restart the process with a different dataset.

#Example Input and Output
Input CSV File Example
csv:
PassengerId,Survived,Pclass,Name,Sex,Age,SibSp,Parch,Ticket,Fare,Cabin,Embarked
1,0,3,"Braund, Mr. Owen Harris",male,22,1,0,A/5 21171,7.25,,S
2,1,1,"Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley",female,38,1,0,PC 17599,71.2833,C85,C
3,1,3,"Heikkinen, Miss. Laina",female,26,0,0,STON/O2. 3101282,7.925,,S
Output Example
Total Passengers: 891
Survived: 342
Not Survived: 549

#Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas to extend the functionality of the project:
Data Visualization:
Add charts and graphs to represent survival rates by gender, class, etc.
Improved Prediction Models:
Train and integrate advanced machine learning models.
Individual Passenger Prediction:
Allow users to input details for a single passenger and get a survival prediction.
Database Integration:
Store historical datasets and predictions for future reference.
